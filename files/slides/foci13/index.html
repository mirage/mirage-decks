      ## The Challenge
      
      Centralised cloud-hosted services are convenient but create risks:
      
      + Loss of data and services due to service shutdown<br />
        (whether for commercial or political reasons)
      + Global passive observers recording <del>&nbsp;all&nbsp;</del> 1.6%
        traffic
      + Inefficient, inconvenient synchronisation in mobile and offline
        environments
      
      <div class="fragment block">
        
        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
        
        <p>
          Use DNS to enable _personal clouds_, making it easy to deploy apps
          that function securely and efficiently on our own device network,
          across the Internet edge
        </p>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
      ## Constraints
      
      + __Compatibility__. Can't require users to change all their apps
      + __Security__. Need to control access to our personal devices: <br />
        requires _authentication_ and _confidentiality_
      + __Connectivity__. Need to be able to interconnect devices whatever
        network is available

        <h3>Data vs Orchestration</h3>
        
        <p>
          What's the minimal network infrastructure that we can deploy to
          represent individual users on the core Internet?

      ## Regaining Connectivity

      + Network Address Translation (NAT) killed end-to-end IP addressing

        (Full-cone NAT? Is UDP blocked? IPSec?)
      + Redirection and proxies (e.g., WiFi hotspots) require traversal

      ## DNS

      DNS is __THE__ Internet naming standard:

      + Supported in almost every embedded device
      + Naturally hierarchical and cacheable
      + Flexible and "extensible"
      + Resolver infrastructure exists almost everywhere (even where censored)

        <code class="bind">
          # host recoil.org<br />
          recoil.org has address 89.16.177.154<br />
          recoil.org mail is handled by 10 dark.recoil.org.<br />

      ## DNS Manipulation

      DNS is __already__ manipulated: content networks differentiate results
      by the query source so the nearest CDN node can serve data

      Indeed,

        <h3>Names for The Average Joe</h3>
        
        <p>
          But there's nowhere for __individuals__ to easily host their own
          little name services online. Change this, and things improve.

      ## DNS Security

      __Authentication__. DNSSEC provides a standard, deployed security model
      where identity chains are established by trusting the registrars or
      other trust anchors
      
      __Confidentiality__. DNSCurve adds confidentiality, repudiability,
      integrity, and authentication to name resolution through an Elliptic
      Curve Cryptographic tunnel; can trade compatibility against overhead,
      with 255-bit Curve25519 keys offering complexity equivalent to 3072-bit
      RSA

      ## Architecture

      ![Signposts architecture](./arch.png)

      At the edge, devices interconnect using tunnels created in response to
      authenticated, confidential DNSCurve queries. Connections
      access-controlled via authenticated query source.

    <script type="text/template">
      ## Active Edge Resolution

      + Incremental, parallel resolution via 0 TTL responses containing
        multiple results
      + Bootstrap trusted public keys between devices via resurrecting
        duckling; no passwords during resolution
      + Degrade gracefully from P2P to personal cloud service to shared
        provider
      + Resolution triggers tunnel establishment scripts; currently support
        (__L2__) Tuntap/SSH, OpenVPN, (__L3__) IPSec, (__L4+__) Privoxy/Tor
        via SOCKS
      + Seamless operation with extra host support (e.g., OpenFlow)

      ## Identity Management

      + Automatic, internal key management in a personal trust hierarchy
        simplifies hygiene
      + TSIG/SIG0 DNSSEC signatures used to demonstrate subnamespace authority
      + Manage keys for SSH, PGP, *Curve in parallel
      + Provides low-friction revocation, making roll-over usable by mortals

      ## Programming Model

      Currently: Sockets API decouples <tt>getaddrinfo(3)</tt> from
      <tt>connect(2)</tt>, so less powerful 

      &nbsp;

      With Signposts:

      + Applications bind names to flows in one call, separating connection
        establishment from data transfer
      + Signpost nodes select environmentally optimal routes via long-poll
        DNSCurve updates
      + Signpost resolver proxies DNS on <tt>localhost</tt>, late-binding
        lookups only when traffic is sent (e.g., <tt>TCP SYN</tt>) 
    </script>
  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
      ## Work-in-Progress

      __Resolution__. Looking to more efficient path establishment than "try
      everything at once"
      
      __Identity__. Automating key derivation & management

      __Programming__. Exploring details, e.g., need to patch OpenSSL, provide
      local OpenFlow switch; more in _The Case for Reconfigurable I/O
      Channels_, RESoLVE 2012 (<http://anil.recoil.org/papers/>)
      
      __Implementation__. May be easier to support applications that use
      sockets via lightweight VMs (e.g., <http://openmirage.org> with
      _Message Switch_, <http://github.com/djs55/message-switch>)

      ## Alternatives & Possibilities

      Signpost uses DNS as a device-facing interface for compatibility -- but
      could support alternative mechanisms for upstream resolution:

      + Perspectives (<http://perspectives-project.org/>) offers a P2P
        trust network
      + Namecoin (<http://namecoin.info/>) provides decentralized naming
        but has economic issues

      When widely deployed, a set of Signposts could help with:

      + Tor. Constructing a mix zone, perhaps using _Dustclounds_
        (http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2010-iswp-dustclouds.pdf)

      + Dissent (<http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/2010/anon/>), simplifying its use
        by Average Joe
